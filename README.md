# Emsi Job Change Dataset Dashboard

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Tableau Public dashboard created to analyze and summarize the Emsi Job Change dataset. The dashboard visualizes the job changes at the **industry**, **subindustry**, and **city** levels, providing insights into trends and patterns in job movement.

The dataset was sourced from **Tableau Public** and has been used to generate various visualizations that offer valuable insights for businesses, job seekers, and economists.

## Key Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
- **Industry-level Job Changes**: Shows the overall job change trends across different industries.
- **Subindustry-level Job Changes**: Breaks down the job change trends by subindustry, allowing for a more granular view of the job market.
- **City-level Job Changes**: Displays job movement trends across cities, highlighting areas with significant job transitions.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to provide an interactive and informative dashboard that helps users to:
- Explore job change patterns in different industries and regions.
- Identify key trends in job growth and decline.
- Analyze the movement of jobs at the city level to support decision-making for individuals, companies, and policymakers.
